 <h3 align="center">Now adays many people think that it all started on the 7th of october 2023, however the truth is that it all started in 1948. Palestinians refer to it as “Al Nakba”, which literally translates as “The Catastrophe”. It refers to the mass exodus of at least 750,000 Arabs from Palestine. Though most believe this event began in 1948, in fact, Al Nakba began decades earlier.
    "Expelling people from their homes is a war crime. As well as preventing them from returning. Israel didn't just commit a war crime in 1948 but continues to commit one to this day." </h3>
<p class="para" align="center">Since 1948, Palestine has experienced significant changes and challenges, primarily due to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the establishment of the state of Israel. Here's an overview:

    1948 Arab-Israeli War (Nakba): Following the declaration of the State of Israel in 1948, neighboring Arab countries invaded Israel, leading to a war. 750,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes, leading to what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or "catastrophe." This resulted in the creation of Palestinian refugee communities, many of which still exist today.
    
    Occupation of Territories: After the 1948 war, Israel gained control over a significant portion of historic Palestine. In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, along with the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula. These territories remain a central point of contention, with ongoing disputes over borders, settlements, and sovereignty.
    
    Israeli Settlements: Israel has constructed settlements in the occupied territories, which are considered illegal under international law. These settlements continue to expand and affect the lives of Palestinians, leading to land confiscation, restricted movement, and challenges to the viability of a future Palestinian state.
    
    Palestinian Authority: In the 1990s, the Oslo Accords led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), granting limited self-governance in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, final-status issues, such as borders, refugees, Jerusalem, and settlements, remained unresolved.
    
    Conflict and Violence: Periodic outbreaks of violence, clashes, and wars have occurred between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, such as Hamas in Gaza or various factions in the West Bank. These conflicts have resulted in civilian casualties on both sides and have contributed to further animosity and distrust.
    
    Humanitarian and Socio-Economic Challenges: Palestinians in the occupied territories face challenges related to access to resources, movement restrictions, unemployment, poverty, and inadequate infrastructure due to the prolonged conflict and occupation. Gaza, in particular, faces a severe humanitarian crisis due to blockades and conflicts.
    
    International Diplomatic Efforts: There have been numerous international efforts, including peace talks, resolutions, and initiatives by various countries and organizations to broker peace and find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, a lasting resolution has remained elusive due to complex political, historical, and territorial issues.
    
    The situation in Palestine remains a deeply complex and sensitive issue, with ongoing efforts by various parties to achieve a peaceful and sustainable resolution to the conflict.</p>
